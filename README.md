# NY Times Best Seller Books List API ðŸ“š

> All the books that are fit to print

## Introduction
I made an API using the [NY Times Developer Network](https://developer.nytimes.com/). I am constantly looking at the NY Times Best Seller List and I thought what better way to use that data than to make it in to an API that I can use for future projects.

This API lists the following information:
- Title of the book,
- Author of the book,
- A brief description of the book synopsis,
- The book's ranking on the Best Seller List,
- An image of the book

See below for a snippet of the JSON format:

The below link will take you to the full array of all the books on the Best Seller List.

**Looking up a book by title**

To search for a book by title, use the below endpoint followed by the book title.

```
https://nytimes-book-api.herokuapp.com/books/title
```

For example, if you wanted to look up the book titled 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow' you would use the link below.

```
https://nytimes-book-api.herokuapp.com/books/title/Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow
```

Which should display the below:

![Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](./assets/Tomorrow.png?raw=true "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow JSON")

---
**Looking up a book by author**

To search for a book by author, use the below endpoint followed by the book author.

```
https://nytimes-book-api.herokuapp.com/books/author
```
For example, if you wanted to look up the book written by Harlan Coben you would use the link below.

```
https://nytimes-book-api.herokuapp.com/books/author/harlan coben
```

Which should display the below:

![Harlan Coben](./assets/Harlan.png?raw=true "Harlan Coben JSON")

- Please note searching by title or author is NOT case-sensitive so you can write the title or author in all caps, lowercase, or any other variation and it will still find the title or author!

---
**Looking up a book by its rank**

To search for a book by its ranking in the Best Seller List, use the below endpoint followed by the book's rank.

```
https://nytimes-book-api.herokuapp.com/books/rank
```
For example, if you wanted to look up the 3rd book in the ranking you would use the link below.

```
https://nytimes-book-api.herokuapp.com/books/rank/3
```

Which should display the below:

![3rd book in rank](./assets/3.png?raw=true "3rd book in rank JSON")
